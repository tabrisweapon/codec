# codec
I used to record my solution of problems from leetcode & PAT with evernote, However, I found it has poor support for syntax highlighting as well as markdown. So I decide to change my tech stack to atom+markdown+git, which also give me the ability to manage the codes and problems in different category and snapshot.
